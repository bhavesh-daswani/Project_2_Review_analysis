One of the best CGM and app interface !",5.0,"The user interface of the app is fantastic and provides precise results. Initially, it requires a 24-hour calibration period. After this, I noticed some discrepancies in accuracy, so I contacted customer support. Impressively, they responded within an hour and provided a Glucometer to verify the app's readings. After recalibration, the app's accuracy improved significantly.I'm also a user of the Ultrahuman air ring, and I appreciate how seamlessly it integrates with the app, offering comprehensive data analysis.The app is proactive in its reminders, prompting scans in the morning and periodically throughout the day. It's particularly useful after meals, suggesting short walks and other actions if a glucose spike is detected.This tool has been instrumental in understanding my glucose levels and how different meals affect them, allowing me to make informed dietary adjustments.I even got one for my wife, and she's equally impressed.Overall, this product is my go-to choice and has my full endorsement.Thank you, Ultrahuman.", 14 January 2024

UltraHuman is an UltraScam! Didn’t work after couple of hours of putting on the patch.",1.0,"I bought it and after the first reading when I tried to read the second time the patch started showing your blood sugar level as crashed with a reading of “51”. I was feeling well. Just to be doubly sure I checked my blood level with the pin prick accu. It showed 174. But not wanting to give up on the convenience of the mobile phone reading wanted to give Ultrahuman a fair chance. Also their WhatsApp support told me that usually such reading become good after a day or so. Tried for many hours and the next day, fully frustrated, removed it to send it back for refund. After many frustrating days of complaints with many people and satisfying them with proofs like photograph of the readings, etc. they refused to give the refund. TL;DR - Avoid UltraHuman.

Hyped marketing for a mobile app",1.0,"This includes a Libre CGM sensor. ""Ultrahuman M1"" is a sticker worth INR 10 on top of this and a free mobile app which reads the NFC CGM. This app reads the glucose level (and the Heart Rate, HRV, if you allow) and comes up with a ""metabolic score"" - which makes no sense whatsoever.""Ultrahuman"", ""Cyborg"" - all nice hype and gimmick. No mention of Libre Sensor anywhere in their product. You get know when you open the box!One would be better off to get a CGM at lower price and use the rest of the metrics in Apple Health, or Fitbit/Garmin Apps and track more useful health data. There are other free apps to read the glucose levels from the CGM, don't really need a separate reader that Abbot sells as well.", 24 November 2022

Do not buy. It is Inaccurate, Expensive and gives wrong information.",1.0,"I wanted to like this product. I ended up disliking it immensely.1. It is inaccurate. My piece showed 20 points lower than what an Accucheck blood sugar monitor does. It asks you to calibrate the levels against an external reference. What's the point of spending so much if every sensor needs to be calibrated. (btw, the Accucheck showed the same reading as a reputed diagnostic lab)2. It is wildly misleading. It says that the normal range is 70-110 at *all times*, which is WRONG. It is well known that this range is considered normal when one has been fasting (12 or more hours since the last meal).  Once you have eaten something, the sugar will go up, which is absolutely ok, as long as it settles down to 140 or below two hours later. To simplify, a normal person would have less than 110 on waking up, and less than 140 two hours after a big meal. The M1 starts screaming anytime the level is more than 110, which makes NO sense at all. I pointed this out to their support and to the CEO/Founder, who sent me a bunch of research papers, none of which had anything to do with this basic error.3. The app allows you to annotate the graph with events such as meals, exercise, sleep etc. But it still has no clue about post-prandial sugar, which defeats a big reason for entering these details.4. It is expensive. The sensor costs Rs. 6000 for 14 days (1 day is taken in auto-calibration), after which you have to throw it. And each replacement will have to be newly calibrated (see point 1)5. The app interface looks slick at first sight, but is AWFUL; it is basically a clutter of advertisements. The opening screen shows the Ring; I was most confused until I learnt that they are hawking another product. You are constantly urged to subscribe for something or the other. One can enter food details, but it is very limited (compare to HealthifyMe).  The list goes on.6. The packaging is gorgeous, but once unpacked, there are no directions about how to install it. The app, as I said, is useless. I finally had to rely on someone's youtube video.7. Having to change it every 15 days contributes a whole chunk of plastic to the landfill.The only good thing about this product is its slick marketing.", 18 January 2023

Avoid, Indians are being given inferior product vs Europeans/Americans (2016 vs 2023 Tech)",1.0,"So I got the Ultrahuman M1 to track my glucose readings (I am not Diabetic but its genetic so precautionary tracking).First of all you get a package with Freestyle Libre Pro (launched in 2016), alcohol wipes and some patches to protect the sensor. If you are for some reason not able to install it properly, they provide a mail letter to send for free replacement. This is a nice touch and removes the hesitation of first time installation.Installing was a bit weird cause when I was trying to push the applicator it was not working. Saw the video and read instructions and it said it should be easy push Eventually it did work after 10 mins of fiddling. Libre's competitor is Dexcom which has a button press apply which is much better.Now coming to how these things work, they work with interstitial fluid (which is fluid that surrounds the cells of the tissues below your skin). Now Glucose enters bloodstream first and then diffuses to interstitial glucose. This causes a lag between the actual glucose and what this reads. This can vary from 10 mins to an hour depending on individual to individual.Since Libre Pro was released in 2016, it is now ancient technology which has quite some lag. Imaging using a 2016 phone now. Abbott has released Libre 3 quite some back which has much better readings. The MRP mentioned on the sensor was Rs 2661.I was surprised by this since in Europe they give Libre 2 in Jan 2022. You can google Techcruch review to see this. Libre 3 was approved in May 2022 and they might be giving that sensor to Americans/Europeans now.Now it takes 8-24 hours to initialize, where it might give false reading. For me even after 24 hours the reading were too high and I compared it with Blood monitor and there was a significant difference of 20-30 mg/dL. It also thought the same and asked me to calibrate it. So you would need a blood glucometer to calibrate it otherwise readings will be way off.Reading wise it is not reliable and you need to check with glucometer regularly.Their app is a bit confusing and filled with their own advertisement so much that it can be difficult to find stuff that you want to see (in my case food review, glucose readings, etc.). Most other apps will show you the product you have at the home page and all data their. But not Ultrahuman. You will just see big bold adds of their products all over.Finally when you get to the page you need, you can enter food details, sleep details, activity details and be able to correlate to spike or crashes. This can help you identify foods that makes your glucose level rise significantly. There is also a ChatGPT integration (their words) that suggests you what you can do with the means.Overall I would suggest don't go with the product. It is overpriced for an inferior product. Instead go with Abbott Freestyle Libre 3 or Dexcom G7 directly and couple that with food logging in Healthifyme. You can get the job done at 50% of the cost. Slightly more effort but paying double for it is not worth it esp for outdated tech.There are also Healthifyme and one more company that offers this. I haven't checked them in detail out but the rates are same. Not sure which sensor they send.TLDR: Indians are given inferior 2016 tech against Europeans/Americans who get the latest. Overpriced with a cluttered ad full app. Not at all for diabetics as readings are not accurate and you need to calibrate.", 5 August 2023
